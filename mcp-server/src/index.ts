  "Check Shippable for pending reviewer interactions. Call this tool when the user mentions reviewing code, pulling reviewer feedback, checking shippable, or asks about review comments. Returns a `<reviewer-feedback>` envelope with one `<interaction id=\"…\" target=\"…\" intent=\"…\" author=\"…\" authorRole=\"…\" file=\"…\" lines=\"…\">…</interaction>` per pending entry. IMPORTANT: each `<interaction>` carries an `id` attribute — you MUST capture it (alongside the body) so you can later report back via `shippable_post_review_comment`. The pending queue is drained on read, so this is the only chance to read the id.";

  "Post a review interaction back to Shippable. Two modes, distinguished by which fields you supply:\n\n" +
  "• Reply mode — set `parentInteractionId` (the id from a `<interaction>` element returned by `shippable_check_review_comments`) and `intent` to 'accept' | 'reject' | 'ack'. Use after addressing one of the reviewer's interactions.\n\n" +
  "• Top-level mode — set `target` ('line' | 'block'), `file` (repo-relative path), `lines` (e.g. '118' or '72-79'), and `intent` to 'comment' | 'question' | 'request' | 'blocker'. Use when you noticed something on your own and want to start a fresh thread on a particular line or range.\n\n" +
  "Put your prose in `replyText`. Also call when the user asks you to 'report back to shippable' or similar.";
